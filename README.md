## Project Description

Human life is very precious and consists of very complicated structure and millions of functions. The health sector should provide the best medical facilities to a
common person. As Pakistan is a developing nation in the field of health sciences and developing a large scale of hospitals but facing a large number of problems
in inter-structure facilities. The basic working of administration in various hospitals of Pakistan is still on paper which makes the process a lot slower as compared
to the hospitals in Europe because there the computers have been put in to assist the hospital personnel in their work.

The concept of automation in the management of hospitals should now be implemented in Pakistan. Our project is aimed to achieve and realize the above concept i.e.
automated administration of Hospital. Hospital management system (HMS) aims to provide the benefits of streamlined operations, enhanced administration
and control, superior patient care, pharmacy, medical labs, and strict cost control. Hospital management app implements hospital management system with a desktop
application Interface that will manage the data related to any particular hospital.
